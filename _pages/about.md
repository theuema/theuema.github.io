My name is Mario, and I'm a *passionate engineer* who enjoys *building software systems that integrate and automate data sources*. My interests consist of both the technical aspects of software development and the process of extracting meaningful insights from data through statistical and machine learning methods. In addition to developing innovative solutions, I'm eager to *improve, extend, and automate processes for existing systems* in order to solve problems, elevate code quality, and enhance efficiency.

What motivates me is to advance further in software development and engineering practices while also expanding my expertise in data analytics, machine learning, and data visualization. Next to my technical abilities, I'm interested to hone project planning and management skills within collaborative, agile team environments.

With over a decade in the semiconductor industry as a mechatronics engineer and *years in diverse roles like software engineer, academic research assistant, and data scientist*, I bring a robust background complemented by a *Masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering and Management* from [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/). My career includes contributions in academia and industry, emphasizing initiative, meticulous documentation, and the clear communication of complex ideas.

My current employer is [SkySpecs](https://www.skyspecs.com), a leading provider of drone-based wind turbine inspection services and data analytics, where I'm responsible for *developing and extending algorithms utilizing SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) time-series data* to address critical challenges in the wind industry, such as the production loss assessment, pitch misalignment detection, performance analysis, and more, focusing on broad applicability and efficiency for large wind farm portfolios. As a member of the product improvement and innovation teams with a background in software engineering, I'm actively involved in *enhancing the software development process by introducing a novel microservice architecture, improving code quality, and automating both data processing and data analysis pipelines*.
