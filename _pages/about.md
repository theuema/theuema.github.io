My name is Mario Theuermann, and I am passionate about extracting meaningful information and advancing knowledge from data by using statistical and machine learning methods. I enjoy software development and automating workflows to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and elevate code quality. What motivates me is to develop further in data analytics, applying various machine learning models, and data visualization, in order to provide valuable insights. Next to my technical expertise I am motivated to cultivate leadership and strategic planning skills within collaborative, agile team environments.

With over a decade in the semiconductor industry as a mechatronics engineer and years in diverse roles like software engineer, academic research assistant, and data scientist, I bring a robust background complemented by a Masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering and Management from Graz University of Technology. My career includes contributions in academia and industry, emphasizing initiative, meticulous documentation, and the clear communication of complex ideas.
