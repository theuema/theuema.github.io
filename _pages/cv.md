## Data Scientist at SkySpecs

- Develop and extend algorithms to address key challenges in the wind industry, such as loss of energy assessment, pitch misalignment, performance analysis and more, focusing on broad applicability and efficiency for large wind farm portfolios.
- Work primarily with Python, Pandas, and Plotly to develop and maintain data processing pipelines and visualize time series data.
- Use statistical and machine learning methods to analyze, classify, cluster and interpret SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) data of individual wind turbines, in order to identify and predict anomalies and performance issues.
- Lead the transition of final prototypes to production, including big-scale testing and integration into the existing software infrastructure, for monthly execution across more than 3000 client wind turbines.
